<!-- ### Industry Experience -->
### Research Experience

1. **Visual Intelligence Lab and Field Robotics Lab, Northeastern University** <br>
    Graduate Research Assistant <br>
    Advised by Prof. [Huaizu Jiang](https://jianghz.me/) and Prof. [Hanumant Singh](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/singh-hanumant/)

    - Introduced SNAP, the first unified segmentation model capable of handling diverse point cloud domains (indoor, outdoor, aerial) for interactive instance segmentation. SNAP provides an average improvement of **20.6%** on 9 zero shot datasets over competitive methods. 
    - Introduced NeuFlow-V2, a optical flow estimation network that runs 10-70x faster than comparitive accuracy baselines.
    - Built a system architecture using GPS-PPS signal for 100ms precise synchronization of multi-UAV cameras to be used for Dynamic 4D mapping. <br><br>

2. **Visual Lighting Group, Signify** <br>
    Computer Vision Research Intern <br>
    Advised by [Dr. Jin Yu](https://jinyu2.github.io/), [Dr. Victor Robles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorarobles), [Dr. Sara Shishehchi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sara-shishehchi-a3774b58)

    - Developed a GAN architecture to generate synthetic bedroom images with lights on/off using
    feature disentanglement.
    - Developed a Style transfer based method for realistic insertion of objects into images for given
    lighting conditions. <br><br>

3. **Unmanned Aerial Systems Research Team, Delhi Technological University** <br>
    Team Captain <br>
    Advised by Prof [N S Raghava](https://dtu.irins.org/profile/66966)

    - Led cross-functional team of 65 engineers across software, avionics, and airframe divisions through complete autonomous UAV swarm development lifecycle, securing $1.5M in project funding.
    - Architected and deployed motion planning algorithms with collision and deadlock avoidance for 25-UAV swarm architecture on Ardupilot and ROS, achieving 300+ hours of successful field validation.
    - Integrated advanced navigation systems including dynamic obstacle avoidance, visual-inertial odometry for GPS-denied environments, and precision payload delivery capabilities.
    - Coordinated hardware-software integration across multidisciplinary teams, managing project timeline, resource allocation, and stakeholder communication with military and academic partners.
